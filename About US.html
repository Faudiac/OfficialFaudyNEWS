        <h2> About us </h2>

        <p class="note">
            Faudy News is a News article and news video sharing 
            company. Faudy news is a public news sharing website 
            made by the Faudiax Company. 
        </p>

        <p class="note">
            The owner of Faudy News company is Faudi himself who created 
            this website from scratch in the year 2023 which today its celebrating its 
            3 month aniversary. Faudiax company was made in the year 2019 which also at 
            the begining the company had to shut down until Faudiax Productions was made 
            making the the very first Faudy news video.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
            Faudy News from that day onwards was a news video sharing company until the year 2023
            which the Faudy News website was made sharing news articles, And Hopefully in the Future 
            making a profit.
        </p>

        <h2> Recent Updates </h2>
        
        <p class="note">
          Faudy News Update 4.0 adds side nav and a seperate and wider browsable search. We also fixed some issue's 
          with the website and changed the design thus colour pallete and still we'll be working on the colour pallete and 
          more etc..
        </p>

      <p class="note">
        We added popups and events banners into the website. Including dynamic picture lighting and news articles 
        being able to inclue all the details about the headline which makes it so that Videos and pictures about the 
        headline can be seen in one page which reduces the stress on the Faudy News Servers and increasing the Website 
        Speed.
      </p>

      <h2> Future Updates </h2>

      <p class="note">
        HopeFully in the Near future we will be able to add commenting on news articles from this website.
        Sooner in the near future are major plans are to make this website an app that can run from any device 
        without the help of any search engines.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Either ways these plans will indeed take time and the attempt to achieve them has officially started 
        and hopefully some of the plans will be released the coming year in 2024.
      </p>
