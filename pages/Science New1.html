        <h2>Blast Off to jupiters icy moons!</h2>

        <img src="../Images/science news 1.png" alt="Star News" class="starNews">

        <p class="note">
            The European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched its JUICE spacecraft to 
            study Jupiter’s icy moons on Friday, April 14th. The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer 
            mission will visit three of Jupiter’s largest moons — Europa, Ganymede, and 
            Callisto — to investigate whether they could be potentially habitable, a question 
            that has been igniting debate among astronomers since the first evidence of subsurface
            oceans on these moons was seen by the Galileo mission in the 1990s. 
        </p>

        <p class="note">
            The Mission for the Juice space rocket is to investigate whether Jupiter’s moons could potentially 
            be habitable. The launch had to occur within a tiny window of just one second in order to work with 
            the spacecraft’s complex trajectory. The spacecraft will start its orbit around the Earth soon making 
            a fly by of Earth and moon in August 2024.

        <h3> HOW WILL WE REACH JUPITER </h3>

        <p class="note">
            “We have to launch on the second in order to have the right trajectory towards the first 
            orbit around the Sun that will allow us to come back to Earth,” ESA payload system engineer 
            Alessandro Atzei explained in a prelaunch briefing. 
        </p>

        <p class="note">
            Basically they are using gravity of Planets to take us to Jupiter.. (FOR those who don't understand
            learn more about "GRAVITY" on <a href="https://faudiac.github.io/Faudiac/"> Faudiac</a> )

        <h3> WHEN WILL THE SPACE SHIP REACH JUPITER </h3>

        <p class="note">
            The probe will arrive at the Jupiter system in 2031. These instruments will be used to
             investigate Jupiter’s moons, with a particular focus on Ganymede. Ganymede is unusual in 
             that it is the largest moon in the solar system and the only moon known to produce its own magnetic 
             field. That magnetic field sits within the powerful magnetic field of Jupiter, and the two interact 
             producing strong auroras around the moon. Ganymede’s surface is also of interest as it varies in age,
              with both smooth younger terrain and areas of much older pockmarked terrain, which can help scientists 
              understand how the Jupiter system evolved over billions of years.
        </p>

        <h3> What are we expecting </h3>

        <p class="note">
            We humans are expecting habitability of life on other plannets but Earth and to do so we 
            have to search the Jupiter system..
